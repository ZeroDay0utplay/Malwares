# Malwares

## 1) Backdoor :
- a python advanced persistent RAT embeddable with any binary wanted with multiple features like screensharing, opening target camera, mic recording, camera shot, keylogging, executing shell cmds. 
- To install Vidstream module, we need to download pyaudio binaries from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio and install it locally (cd to it's dir and pip install *.whl).
- Note: the audio.whl file should be with the same version as your python interpreter version.
- install pynput==1.6.8.
- For Screen Sharing we need to install pillow package (pip install pillow)
- To activate AV Evasion the Backdoor should be run as admin

## 2) CryptoMiner:
- a C/C++ cryptocurrency mining malware fully undetectable, persistent, embeddable with any binary wanted, closes itself when task manager is opened and reopens itself when TM is closed, a little bit intelligent when picking up the number of threads for mining (to be less suspicious for the target when taking resources), working on all types of windows arch and the for the XP too and later I'll add the unix version.
